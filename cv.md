# Summary

For the time being, i am busy with small projects that are given by the mentor of the online course on Udemy. My goal is to become a software engineer. Moreover, i am very motivated to learn new things and technologies. When it comes to my interest, i love reading books, listening to smarter people than me. In fact, i am not fun of telling personal strengths, but if i have to, i can grow individually and by collaborating with others. I will do my best to use this great chance provided by RS School mentors and strengthen my knowledge.
